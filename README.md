# PSU-CIDD-MaSim-Support

This repository contains analysis files used for modeling the prevalence of malaria (*P. falciparum*) in in various countries using the main malarial simulation. 

The main repository for the simulation can be found at [maciekboni/PSU-CIDD-Malaria-Simulation](https://github.com/maciekboni/PSU-CIDD-Malaria-Simulation)

### Usage
Presently these scripts are only tested to run on Linux or Windows vis the Windows Subsystem for Linux. In order to run these scripts you will first need to `git clone` the repository to your local computer. Once cloned you can access them by adding them to the `PATH` variable:

**Per Session**, from the root of the repository
```bash
PATH=$PATH:`pwd`
```

**Via Configuration**
1. Open `.bashrc` (`vi ~/.bashrc`)
2. Add the line `PATH=$PATH:path_to_repository` where `path_to_repository` is the full path to the root of the repository.
3. Save and close
4. Reload `.bashrc` (`source ~/.bashrc`)

### Repository Organization

/ - The root directory contains scripts that may be run from the command line that of use with the simulation.

bash/ - The `bash` directory contains Bash scripts as well as job files that may be manipulated by the Bash scripts to run replicates on the [Roar Supercomputer](https://www.icds.psu.edu/computing-services/roar-user-guide/).

include/ - The `include` directory contains Python scripts that contain shared code and cannot be run on their own.
