# EarthEngine Documentation

This directory contains a generalized version of [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) scripts that may be of use when calibrating the [malaria model](https://github.com/bonilab/Temple-Malaria-Simulation). Execution of these scripts will require the creation of a [Google Earth Engine account](https://earthengine.google.com/noncommercial/).
